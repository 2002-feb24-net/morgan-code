Class/Object - Related data and logic/behavior

static - does not require an object instance. 1 copy of that thing for the whole program

non-static/instance - exist on one particular object at a time. Can have many of these  

access modifiers: 
    public - can set them as public instead
    private - private by deafult

DRY principle: Don't repeat yourself
